    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      music: preferences.music,
      movies: preferences.movies,
      cuisine: preferences.cuisine,
      fashion: preferences.fashion,
      location: preferences.location
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};


### LLM Integration
javascript
// Example LLM prompt with Qloo data
const generateRecommendations = async (tasteProfile, userQuery) => {
  const prompt = `
    User taste profile: ${JSON.stringify(tasteProfile)}
    User query: ${userQuery}
    Location: ${userQuery.location}
    
    Based on this taste profile from Qloo's Taste AI, provide personalized 
    recommendations that connect cultural preferences across domains.
  `;
  
  // Call to LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
  const response = await llmAPI.generate(prompt);
  return response;
